# MidiExtractor
Extracts midi files from binary file.

Made in like 2 hours on a whim to extract midis from an asset pack file. I already know it's awful.

## Notes for the MinGW branch
This is the file I wrote first... I couldn't find a good way to create folders in a portable way, so ***you'll have to create a folder named "output" in the same directory as the program***. Otherwise, it won't really do anything.
