# MidiExtractor
Made in like 2 hours on a whim to extract midis from an asset pack file. I already know it's awful.

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 to build the solution.

Specifically for extracting midis from [The Big Catch: Tacklebox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2985610/The_Big_Catch_Tacklebox/).
For the record, this was made purely as a learning experience once I found out that The Big Catch used sequenced music... If the devs do have a problem with this, I will gladly take it down.
